#eureka and clog config props are here because we have a spring-cloud-starter-bootstrap in the pom
#spring-cloud-starter-bootstrap in the pom is required to invoke the bootstrap.properties file before launching the app

#to be able to register the service with a name to eureka
spring.application.name=ab-paymentservice

#we want multiple instances of this service with random port numbers (all set to 0 in properties)
#so we have to register eureka with some other random id (this is not port)
eureka.instance.instance-id=${spring.application.name}:${random.int(1,10000)}

#for cloud config properties, every line is probably important
spring.cloud.config.discovery.service-id=ab-config-server
spring.cloud.config.fail-fast=true
#spring security username and password in the config-servers properties file
spring.cloud.config.username=aldimbilet
spring.cloud.config.password=config
#with this local profile names the config server endpoint will be "http://localhost:8888/ab-userservice/local"
#also there is another option to create a file called bootstrap-local.properties in userservice and start spring boot app with a profile named "local" 
spring.profiles.active=local
